### Amsel concept
### * all hosts get "base" and "snapclient"
### * "acable" is used to create internal audio connections (similar to alsaloop),
###   "bluetooth_sink" adds the bluetooth infrastructure - but only if at least
###   one bluetooth connection is defined in acable_config.
### * "bluetooth_disable" should be executed for all hosts without any acable
###    configured if you want to be sure that bluetooth is actually switched off.
### * At least one audio server (snapserver) should be defined to actually distribute
###   audio). This needs snd_aloop, snapserver/snapweb and mpd.
