# bluealsa

Installs and configures the `bluealsa` daemon. 

This daemon can read the audio stream from all connected bluetooth A2DP audio sources that are connected via `bluetooth` and play them to an arbitrary alsa sink.

Required to play an audio stream from a bluetooth device (like a mobile phone) to the multiroom system, but not sufficient (needs 2 other roles and an `acable`).
