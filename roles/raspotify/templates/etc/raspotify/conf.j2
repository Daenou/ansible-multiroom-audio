# /etc/raspotify/conf -- Arguments/configuration for librespot

# A non-exhaustive list of librespot options and flags.

# Please see https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify/wiki &
# https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options
# for configuration details and a full list of options and flags.

# You can also find a full list with `librespot -h`.

# To avoid name collisions environment variables must be prepended with
# `LIBRESPOT_`, so option/flag `foo-bar` becomes `LIBRESPOT_FOO_BAR`.

# Invalid environment variables will be ignored.

# Raspotify defaults may vary from librespot defaults.
# Commenting out the environment variable will fallback to librespot's default
# unless otherwise noted.

# Flags are either on (uncommented) or off (commented),
# their values are otherwise not evaluated (but the "=" is still needed).

# Only log warning and error messages.
#LIBRESPOT_QUIET=

# Automatically play similar songs when your music ends.
#LIBRESPOT_AUTOPLAY=

# Disable caching of the audio data.
# Enabling audio data caching can take up a lot of space
# if you don't limit the cache size with LIBRESPOT_CACHE_SIZE_LIMIT.
# It can also wear out your Micro SD card. You have been warned. 
LIBRESPOT_DISABLE_AUDIO_CACHE=

# Disable caching of credentials.
# Caching of credentials is not necessary so long as
# LIBRESPOT_DISABLE_DISCOVERY is not set.

# otherwise they must have a valid value.
