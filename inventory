# You can have any number of inputs playing to the dmix loopback device simultaneously.
# We also configure it as a bluetooth audio sink aka bluetooth loudspeaker.
# Furthermore, we have one snapsclient named "client1", which listens to the snapserver.
# The server1 also has a snapclient installed listening to the local snapserver.
